     <h2>Blown to Bits Reflection</h2>
     <p> A report commissioned by the National Science Foundation and made public today speculates that by the end of this century electronic information technology will have transformed American home, business, manufacturing, school, family and political life. The amount of personal data collected by and stored on computers, and the ease with which it can be accessed, worries many observers. The invasion of privacy by marketers who collect personal data worries most average people. The continuing development of computing technology and the Internet will also increase the opportunities of criminal activity. Terrorism, and virtual fraud are likely to increase as computers become more advanced in society. So transformation of society will be changed as computing continues, but for the good and the bad.

     <h3>Lightbot Reflection</h3>
     <br>
     <h2>"How is Lightbot like a computer? How is Lightbot different than a computer?"</h2>
     <p>Lightbot is like a computer becuase you have to figure out the code to run complete the task, and it teaches you the frustration you get when you don't get it right.
        It is also different from LightBot because unlike the lightbot you have for computer you have to use the actual coding language which is longer.</p>

     <h2>Why is it a good idea to write programs in small pieces and check how well they work after each piece is written?</h2>
     <p> To make sure that it works and to test it to be sure everything is good and ready to go.
     <h2>Think of other tasks in life that require you to figure things out. How is programming similar or different?</h2>
         A task in life that require you to figure things out is guess and check math, you have the answers but you have to plug them into the equation till you find the one you are looking for.
     <h2>Reflect on how well you worked together when pair programming. What could you do next time to make a partnership function even better?</h2> 
         It was good because my partner helped me with flaws I didn’t see that was slowing my coding down. To make the partnership better would be to get a feel of how the other person codes and where they tend to make flaws.
     <h2>How do you think a dual-core computer, for instance, can make it look and feel like it is running ten or more programs at once?</h2>
         The duel core is slower because it’s only two cores and the quad core has 4 cores and reads them just as fast.</p>
