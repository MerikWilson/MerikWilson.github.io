    <h2>Blown to Bits Reflection</h2>
    <p> A report commissioned by the National Science Foundation and made public today speculates that by the end of this century electronic information technology will have transformed American home, business, manufacturing, school, family and political life. The amount of personal data collected by and stored on computers, and the ease with which it can be accessed, worries many observers. The invasion of privacy by marketers who collect personal data worries most average people. The continuing development of computing technology and the Internet will also increase the opportunities of criminal activity. Terrorism, and virtual fraud are likely to increase as computers become more advanced in society. So transformation of society will be changed as computing continues, but for the good and the bad.
