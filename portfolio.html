     <h2>Blown to Bits Reflection</h2>
     
     <paragraphs>
     <p> A report commissioned by the National Science Foundation and made public today speculates that by the end of this century electronic information technology will have transformed American home, business, manufacturing, school, family and political life. The amount of personal data collected by and stored on computers, and the ease with which it can be accessed, worries many observers.
     The invasion of privacy by marketers who collect personal data worries most average people. The continuing development of computing technology and the Internet will also increase the opportunities of criminal activity. Terrorism, and virtual fraud are likely to increase as computers become more advanced in society. So transformation of society will be changed as computing continues, but for the good and the bad.</p>

     <h3>Lightbot Reflection</h3>
     
     <br>
     <h2>"How is Lightbot like a computer? How is Lightbot different than a computer?"</h2>
     
     <paragraphs>
     <p>Lightbot is like a computer becuase you have to figure out the code to run complete the task, and it teaches you the frustration you get when you don't get it right.
        It is also different from LightBot because unlike the lightbot you have for computer you have to use the actual coding language which is longer.</p>

     <h2>Why is it a good idea to write programs in small pieces and check how well they work after each piece is written?</h2>
         To make sure that it works and to test it to be sure everything is good and ready to go.
     <h2>Think of other tasks in life that require you to figure things out. How is programming similar or different?</h2>
         A task in life that require you to figure things out is guess and check math, you have the answers but you have to plug them into the equation till you find the one you are looking for.
     <h2>Reflect on how well you worked together when pair programming. What could you do next time to make a partnership function even better?</h2> 
         It was good because my partner helped me with flaws I didn’t see that was slowing my coding down. To make the partnership better would be to get a feel of how the other person codes and where they tend to make flaws.
     <h2>How do you think a dual-core computer, for instance, can make it look and feel like it is running ten or more programs at once?</h2>
         The duel core is slower because it’s only two cores and the quad core has 4 cores and reads them just as fast.</p>

     <h2>In a large project with hundreds of sprites and scripts, explain why it might help to follow our convention that only one sprite will respond to a message and to follow our naming convention for messages?</h2>
         So that way things are more organized
     <h2>Based on what you learned during this activity, explain what you think events and handlers are?</h2>
         Events are actions that change the program. and handlers affect the movement of the sprites
     <h2>What are some details of the playG() method that are encapsulated by the handler?</h2>
         That he can not affect the internal mechanisms, only just give them instructions.
     <h2>What details mentioned in part a might be useful to expose? In other words, what variations on playG() do you think would be convenient to allow?</h2>
         The cord-nets of each sprite and which broadcast affects each sprite .

     <h2>What do you see as the primary advantage of using a fixed value variable?</h2>
         The primary advantage of using a fixed value variable is that it can be easly change.  It can be tested and modified efficiently.        
     <h2>Write a pseudocode segment that shows usage of a most recent variable that is significantly different than the example given in this activity.</h2>
         If you were entering a transaction and wanted to know the how good it is then you can use a most recent variable to compare. 
     <h2>Explain the accumulator role:</h2>
         List two examples of software you have used that you suspect might have used an accumulator. 
         Video games use an accumulator to keep track how many points you have earned. Also, an online calculator uses the accumulator to add, subtract, divide, etc and gives you an answer.  
     <h2>Choose one of your examples from part (a) and explain what you think the accumulator in the program might have been doing and why this function leads you to classify the object as an accumulator.</h2>
         In a video game, every time a certain goal is accomplished the score is changed. The computer keeps track of these score changes and with the accumulator function gathers the total score.
     <h2>Explain the difference between the accumulator role and the aggregator role.</h2>
         The accumulator only holds on to one number while the aggregator holds on to a whole list.
